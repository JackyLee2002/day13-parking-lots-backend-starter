O: Todays lecture, based on the previous User story map, we decided on the MVP and reflected on the ideas/features which we can delay in a future iterations. Doing so allow the scope of our project to be limited in scale, allowing the development team to be more laser focused in quickly delivering the products.

R: Interested

I: Previously, I would really try to deliver as much as possible within a certain iteration/sprint, sometimes even more when kickstarting a project. This diverted the features that would be used to deliver, in turn slowing down the launch/release of the product. This altered my view on how we decides on feature development/release.

D: In the future, I would like to make use of User Story map more in deciding feature releases/planning, and be less laser focused in only developing feature without much business consideration. For ongoing project, having a User Story/Journey would also be beneficial in prioritizing tasks that should be delivered.

O: Today marks the start of the Bootcamp Project about a ticketing website for the popular Western band Coldplay and their latest tour. We are tasked with delivering the Elevator Pitch, User Persona, User Journey and some story tasks within the day. Althought we barely failed with delivering all of them, we tried our best commuinicating our ideas to each other while also listening and understanding others' perspective.

R: Nervous, Anxious

I: Not having much experience in leading projects using Agile outside of internship/ a few minor school project, I feel nervous in ability to lead the group.
However, seeing how hard eveyone of the team is working and trying their best despite fullstack development not being their line of works. During the ideation time today, we discussed together to come up with different ideas using our own personal experiences and reflecting on common issues faced by concert goers, we were able to pick out a few notable features which would be the irresistable feature of our product PlayCool.

D: I hope everyone in the group will be able to work together like how we did for the group presentations and enjoy our time together while trying to deliver the best product we can within such a limited time.
